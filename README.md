|---|---|---|
| [Programs, Sites and Volunteers Dashboard] | December 2023 | I am an intern for a nonprofit org that has programs in schools(sites) as well as volunteers. We keep track of all the programs, schools, and volunteers in the database system, and I am basing my reports and dashboard off their schema, the data is entirely my own.|
| [Salesforce Lightning - Case Console Record Page] | October 2023 | The Lightning App Builder is a powerful tool for quickly creating and customizing applications in Salesforce. Here I used objects already in salesforce and created a case console record page.|
